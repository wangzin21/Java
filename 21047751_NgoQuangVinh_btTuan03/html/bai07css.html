            MH17 crash: Russia vetoes UN resolution
            for international tribunal
        </h1>
        <div class="newspaper">
            <p>
                Russia has used its veto at the UN to block a draft
                resolution to set up an international tribunal into
                the MH17 air disaster in July 2014. It was the only nation at the 15-member UN Security Council to
                oppose
                the move, triggering widespread condemnation.
                The Malaysian Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in eastern Ukraine, killing all
                298 people on board. Pro- Russian rebels in the area have denied shooting
                down the aircraft. Western nations and Ukraine say there is evidence it was hit by a Russian-supplied
                Buk
                anti-aircraft missile - a claim also denied by Russia. 'Callous disregard'
                Malaysia pushed for an international tribunal to try those responsible. The move was backed by the
                Netherlands which had
                196 nationals on board -
                Ukraine, Belgium and
                Australia.
                Moscow has
                blamed the government in
                Kiev for the disaster.
                Eleven of the 15 UN
                Security Council members
                backed the draft resolution
                Speaking earlier this
                month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the establishment of a
                tribunal would be
                "premature" and "counter- productive".
