                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a
                style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup
                language. Although most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML
                and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
